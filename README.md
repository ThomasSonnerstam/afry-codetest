# AFRY Code Test â€” React + TypeScript + Vite

A small React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It uses Material UI for styling and @tanstack/react-query for data fetching/caching.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes

A localStorage key with the name `afry-code-test` is used to store the companies and employees data.
If you want to delete the data, you can do so by clearing the localStorage.
